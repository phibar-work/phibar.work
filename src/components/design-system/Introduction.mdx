# Design System

Primitive UI components built with [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Primitives

Low-level, accessible building blocks. Each primitive wraps a native HTML element or Radix UI primitive with consistent styling and dark mode support.

| Component    | Description                                      |
|------------- |--------------------------------------------------|
| Button       | Clickable actions with variant and size options   |
| Card         | Composed container with header, content, footer   |
| Checkbox     | Toggle control backed by Radix Checkbox           |
| Input        | Text input field                                  |
| Label        | Accessible label paired with form controls        |
| Pagination   | Page navigation with previous/next and ellipsis   |
| Select       | Dropdown backed by Radix Select                   |
| Textarea     | Multi-line text input                             |

## Theming

Components support light and dark mode via the `.dark` class on the document root. Use the theme toggle in the toolbar above to preview both modes.
